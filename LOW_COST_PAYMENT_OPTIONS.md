# 💰 LOW-COST Payment Solutions for New Jamaican Businesses

## 🚨 THE REAL TALK

You're absolutely right to push back! For a **NEW business**, those NCB fees ARE too high:
- $20,000 JMD setup
- $7,500 JMD/month
- **= $90,000 JMD/year BEFORE you make a sale!**

That's $585 USD/year in fees alone. For a startup, that's **risky**.

## 💡 ANSWERING YOUR QUESTIONS

### **"Why are NCB fees so high?"**

**They're not "high" - they're for ESTABLISHED businesses:**

- Support staff
- Enterprise-level service

**But you're a STARTUP!** You don't need enterprise features yet.

**You WON'T with NCB!** That's the problem:

**With WiPay: Break even immediately!**
- Only pay when you sell
- No fixed costs
- Low risk

---

### **"Do I need to invest at the start?"**

**NO!** Not with the right choice:

**WiPay + Lynk = $0 investment**
- No setup fees
- No monthly fees
- No equipment
- Just your website (already built!)

**Your only investments:**
- Domain/hosting: ~$5,000 JMD/year

- Enterprise-level
- Even more expensive
- For large e-commerce
